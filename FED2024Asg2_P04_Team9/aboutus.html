            <h3>How It All Began</h3>
            <p>
                MokeSell was founded after the discovery of a vintage handbag at a flea market, sparking the idea that luxury doesnâ€™t need to be new. What started as a small collection of secondhand high-end fashion grew into a platform offering curated pre-loved designer clothing, jewelry, bags, and accessories. The brand focuses on sustainability and slow fashion, encouraging customers to embrace eco-friendly choices while celebrating the stories behind each unique piece. MokeSell aims to provide an alternative to fast fashion by making luxury accessible and timeless.
